# Case title: Improving reverse logistics at PostNL

## Case background

Consumers in the Netherlands have the dubious honor to be the ones that send most online purchases back. In the Netherlands, thereâ€™s a return rate of 13 percent, which is more than in countries such as Germany, Poland and Switzerland. Reverse logistics handles these returns. Typically, when you want to return a package, you place an order for a return shipment in the webshop, after which you drop your package at one of the collections points. In the case of PostNL, there are xxxx of these collection points throughout the Netherlands, located in supermarkets and convenience stores. The returned packages are pooled into containers and scheduled for pick-up.

## The challenge

Orders for returns at webshops are placed until late in the evening. The capacity, sorting and route plans for the next few days have already largely been made by then. Hundreds of thousand containers are daily planned for the shipment of packaged goods. Data shows that on average at least 30% of the transport capacity is not utilized. Shortages or a surplus of available containers at a pick-up location leads to inefficient logistics like delays, increasing CO2 emissions and additional costs, let alone the frustration of the personnel at the PostNL franchises. 

Improving the expectation of the volume of packaged and containerised goods translates into an optimized logistical planning. Online and physical stores have different characteristics. Some have highly seasonal volumes, others are very stable. We can use such information to more accurately predict the shipment of containerised goods released for transport.

## The results

For the logistic operations of containers, a Proof of Concept (PoC) is developed to optimize in real-time available container stock at pick-up locations (stores). One of the many pieces of the puzzle for a digital twin in logistics. During this PoC phase, the prediction model is deployed manually per location. In the next phase the predictions are made by a request from a Control Tower application. A place where the expected volume of packaged and containerised goods is closely monitored and compared with the transport planning. Key for success is breaking down the bigger picture into multiple models per customer category that can be validated individually. This approach avoids major investments that later turn out to be unnecessary.

The performance of the model during normal operations show an accuracy of xxx. Furthermore, the model was also able to correctly predict outliers such as Black Friday.  **@Peter: could you add one or two sentences on the performance. How accurate was it, difference between over- vs. underforecasting**

With the help of machine learning, decisions are no longer made based on assumptions but on data, which can be used to determine whether the expectation of the volume of packaged and containerised goods represents reality. As soon as a deviation occurs somewhere, the impact can be calculated to support decisions that are required to fulfill the customer promise.
